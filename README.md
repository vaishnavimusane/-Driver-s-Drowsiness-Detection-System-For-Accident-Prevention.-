Driver's Drowsiness Detection System For Accident Prevention:

Developed a road accident prevention system using Python and machine learning techniques to detect driver 
drowsiness through eye closure and yawning Implemented machine learning algorithms to analyze real-time data 
from drivers facial expressions and movements, identifying signs of drowsingss. Using Python and machine 
learning to create a system that helps prevent accidents in real life showing how technology can solve important 
problems.
